# SECURED-TRANSMISSION-OF-DIGITAL-IMAGES-USING-THM-ENCRYPTED-WATERMARKING-AND-VISUAL-CRYPTOGRAPHY-
# Secure Image Protection System

## Overview
This project implements a **high-security image protection framework** integrating **THM-based chaotic encryption, 2DWT-SVD watermarking, and multi-share visual cryptography (VC)** to ensure **secure transmission and ownership authentication**. The system enhances security by embedding an encrypted watermark, splitting images into multiple secure shares, and utilizing **QR-based verification, lossless compression, and threshold-based reconstruction**.

## Features
- **THM-Based Chaotic Encryption**: Ensures strong key security for watermark encryption.
- **2DWT-SVD Watermarking**: Embeds watermark imperceptibly while ensuring robustness.
- **Multi-Share Visual Cryptography (VC)**: Splits the image into multiple shares for secure access control.
- **QR Code Authentication**: Embeds authentication and integrity verification data.
- **Lossless Compression (JPEG-LS, WebP)**: Optimizes storage and transmission efficiency.
- **Threshold-Based Reconstruction**: Requires a minimum number of shares for reconstruction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyCryptodome (for AES encryption)
- Tesseract-OCR (for text extraction, if required)

## Applications
- **Copyright Protection**: Secures ownership rights of digital images.
- **Medical Image Security**: Protects confidential patient records.
- **Forensic Authentication**: Ensures authenticity of legal and surveillance images.
- **Confidential Document Sharing**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive files.
- **Satellite & Remote Sensing Data Protection**: Secures image transmission from satellites.
